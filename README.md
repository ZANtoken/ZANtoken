**ZANtoken/ZANtoken** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This project is made to support all freedom-seeking nations, whose governments have captured them. Our token cooperates in the transfer of humanitarian aid for this nation.
With the collected fees, it helps to establish free and unlimited internet in all directions
